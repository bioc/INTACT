Description: This package integrates colocalization probabilities from 
    colocalization analysis with transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS)
    scan summary statistics to implicate genes that may be biologically relevant 
    to a complex trait. The probabilistic framework implemented in this package 
    constrains the TWAS scan z-score-based likelihood using a gene-level 
    colocalization probability. Given gene set annotations, this package can 
    estimate gene set enrichment using posterior probabilities from the 
    TWAS-colocalization integration step.
